# How to Access Your Exoplanet Analysis

## 🎯 Quick Start

Once the analysis completes, you'll have everything you need in these locations:

### Main Dashboard
**📂 File:** `exoplanet_dashboard.html`
**📍 Location:** Same directory as this file
**🌐 How to open:** Double-click the file, or right-click → Open with → Your web browser

This HTML dashboard contains:
- Summary statistics
- All visualizations with descriptions
- Links to interactive 3D plots
- Explanations of each analysis step

### All Visualization Plots
**📂 Folder:** `plots/`

Contains 8 high-resolution images:
1. `radius_vs_period.png` - Shows all planets in radius vs orbital period space
2. `mass_radius.png` - Mass-radius relationship distinguishing rocky vs gaseous planets
3. `radius_histogram.png` - Distribution showing the famous "radius gap"
4. `insolation_vs_radius.png` - Stellar energy received vs planet size
5. `bls_periodogram.png` - Period detection for TOI-700
6. `folded_lightcurve.png` - Transit signal visualization
7. `feature_importance.png` - ML model feature rankings
8. `interactive_3d.html` - **Interactive 3D plot** (double-click to open in browser!)

### Raw Data Files
**📂 Folder:** `data/`

- `exoplanet_catalog.csv` - Full NASA dataset with all computed features
- `toi700_lightcurve.csv` - TESS light curve time series data

You can open these CSV files in Excel, Python, or any data analysis tool.

## 🔄 How to Re-run the Analysis

If you want to run the analysis again (to get updated data from NASA):

```bash
cd "C:\Users\russp\OneDrive\Documents\School\strat490\firstapp\astroproject"
python3 exoplanet_analysis.py
```

The script will:
1. Download latest exoplanet data from NASA
2. Download TESS light curves
3. Perform all analyses
4. Create all visualizations
5. Build the ML classifier
6. Generate the dashboard

**Time:** Takes ~3-5 minutes depending on your internet connection

## 📊 What Each Visualization Shows

### 1. Radius vs Period
Shows where planets exist in size-orbit space. Hot Jupiters are large planets close to their stars (short periods), while super-Earths and mini-Neptunes occupy different regions.

### 2. Mass-Radius
Helps distinguish planet composition. Rocky planets have a different mass-radius relationship than gaseous planets.

### 3. Radius Histogram
Shows the "Fulton Gap" around 1.5-2.0 Earth radii - a mysterious gap in planet sizes that separates super-Earths from mini-Neptunes.

### 4. Insolation vs Radius
Shows how much stellar energy planets receive. The green zone marks potentially habitable conditions.

### 5. BLS Periodogram
Shows the orbital period detected for TOI-700 using transit timing analysis.

### 6. Folded Light Curve
When you "fold" observations at the orbital period, the transit signal becomes clear - this is how we detect exoplanets!

### 7. Feature Importance
Shows which physical parameters are most useful for classifying planets as rocky vs gaseous.

### 8. Interactive 3D (HTML)
Rotate and explore the dataset in 3D! Hover over points to see planet names.

## 🤖 Machine Learning Results

The Random Forest classifier was trained to distinguish:
- **Rocky planets** (radius < 1.6 Earth radii)
- **Gaseous planets** (radius ≥ 1.6 Earth radii)

Key features used:
- Orbital period
- Stellar insolation
- Equilibrium temperature
- Stellar radius
- Stellar effective temperature

The model shows that physical properties can effectively predict planet type!

## 📝 For Your Report

All analyses follow the workflow from README.md:
✓ Downloaded NASA Exoplanet Archive catalog
✓ Downloaded TESS light curves (TOI-700)
✓ Created exploratory visualizations
✓ Performed Box Least Squares transit detection
✓ Engineered physical features (insolation, temperature)
✓ Built machine learning classifier
✓ Created interactive dashboard

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

**Q: Plots aren't showing up**
A: Make sure the `plots/` folder exists and check that the script completed without errors.

**Q: Dashboard looks broken**
A: Make sure the `plots/` folder is in the same directory as `exoplanet_dashboard.html`.

**Q: Interactive 3D plot won't open**
A: The file `plots/interactive_3d.html` needs a web browser. Try right-click → Open With → Chrome/Firefox/Edge.

**Q: Want to modify the analysis?**
A: Edit `exoplanet_analysis.py` and re-run it. The code is well-commented!

## 🌟 Tips

1. **For presentations:** Use the dashboard HTML - it looks professional!
2. **For reports:** Use the high-res PNG images from the `plots/` folder
3. **For further analysis:** Use the CSV files in the `data/` folder
4. **Interactive demos:** Use the 3D plot - it's impressive!
